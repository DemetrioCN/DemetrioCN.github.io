            Hey! I'm <strong>Demetrio</strong>. 
            Coding has changed my world. It's not just about apps. Learning to code gave me <i> problem-solving skills</i> 
            and a way to communicate with others on a technical level. Ican also develop websites and use my coding skills 
            to get a better job. And I learned it all at <strong>SoloLearn</strong> where they build your self-esteem and 
            keep you motivated. Join me in this rearding journey.  You'll have fun, get help, and learn along the way!
