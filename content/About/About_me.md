Title: About me
Date: 2024-05-13
## Hi! My name's Demetrio

I'm interested in AI Safety and Nature Exploration. I've been leading digital transformation projects across LATAM as a data scientist and project manager. Right now, I'm focusing on learning AI safety to set the stage for an upcoming research project. I'm really motivated by Dan Hendrycks and Ilya Sutskever's work in this field.

**Broadly, my story is as follows:**

<font color="blue">[2024 - present] </font> I've embarked on my open-source "Master's" journey in machine learning, with a particular focus on AI Safety.

<font color="blue">[2024 - present] </font> I have a passion for scientific exploration in remote locations. Recently, I've begun taking courses in spelunking, with the aim of joining the [Sistema Huautla project](https://www.peshcaving.org/).

<font color="blue">[2022 - present] </font> I work as a Data Scientist and Project Manager at Exploration and Discovery Technologies leading the digital transformation for consumer packaged goods companies in LATAM. 

<font color="blue">[2021 - 2022] </font> I worked as a Data Scientist at Intelimetrica creating geospatial data pipeline for digital transformation.

<font color="blue">[2018 - 2019] </font> I worked as a research assistant, testing models for electronic repulsion integrals optimization in the theoretical chemistry department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico.
