## My Open-Source ML "Master's"

The future will be fascinating!

After several months of contemplation and research on the future of humanity and the emergence of general artificial intelligence, I've become somewhat concerned about the limited number of individuals worldwide conducting research on security and ethics regarding the development of these models. After some reflection, I've decided to embark on creating an Open Source Machine Learning Master's program with a focus on AI Safety, driven primarily by the goal of ensuring a safe and captivating future for humanity.

### What is an Open Source Machine Learning Master?
It's becoming increasingly common, due to financial and professional development reasons, for students to pursue entirely online careers given the diversity of free and accessible resources available on the internet. That's what the Open Source Machine Learning Master's is all about: you decide what knowledge to acquire and create a learning path to achieve your goals. An important aspect of this process is to demonstrate the skills you're acquiring in various forms: published works, videos, blogs, books, podcasts, etc.

### What is my learning path?
1. Classical algorithms in Machine Learning: Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
2. Theory of Computation
3. Deep Learning
4. Deep Reinforcement Learning
5. Philosophy and ethics for science
6. Research project

### My objectives
1. Contribute to the development of a safer future with AI
2. Obtain a position as a research scientist in AI Safety

### What Does Success Look Like?
1. Create resources for learning AI Safety in both Spanish and English
2. Publish at least 1 article on Arxiv
3. Obtain a position as a Research Scientist
