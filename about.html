        <p class="about-text">Hi! I'm Demetrio. I'm an enthusiast about accelerate science discovery with machine learning and artificial intelligence, a farmer and a spelelogy in training.</p>
        <p class="about-text">
            As a future research scientist I will put my efforts and time into studying, building and implementing models that accelerate scientific discovery primarily in the fields of climate change and ecology. Although I am really interested in any scientific application of artificial intelligence and machine learning models, the purpose is to develop something for the benefit of the future of science.

            As a farmer I really enjoy the family heritage, it is very exciting to be able to grow your own food and that every time you cook you go directly to the field and harvest what you need. 

            It is well known that over the years traditional agriculture has disappeared and has become an industry that degrades the land and breaks the balance between humans and the rest of the ecosystem. Lately some terms have emerged that point to a traditional agriculture: agroecology or food forest, this is nothing more than an effort to return to this balance, regardless of what it is called, I am glad to know that every day more and more of us are getting on this boat.

        <p class="about-text">
            Exploring the world is perhaps one of the oldest activities that human beings do on earth and now in space. Despite the efforts that have been applied to the study and exploration of the earth, there are still some sites as unusual as the great caves and the ocean that are waiting for their wonders to be shown to the world and also allow us to understand a little more about the biology and history of these extreme worlds. I grew up having this feeling of being an explorer, I have done it in some jungles, but now I aim to be a professional at it and be part of a great team that shows the world the wonders that the earth still hides.

        <p class="about-text">In this website I show my knowledge and my adventures in these fields. If you would like to talk about any of these topics, do not hesitate to write me. </p>
